## Scenario 2: You bought Windows 7 Ultimate from Amazon or another online seller
  
If you bought Windows 7 Ultimate from Amazon or another online seller, you may have received a product key in an email or a digital download link. However, you should be careful about the source of your product key, as some sellers may sell counterfeit or stolen keys that may not work or may get blocked by Microsoft.

## Scenario 3: You installed Windows 7 Ultimate from an ISO file or a DVD without a product key
  
If you installed Windows 7 Ultimate from an ISO file or a DVD without a product key, you may have used a trial version that allows you to use Windows for a limited time without activation. However, after the trial period expires, you will need to activate Windows with a valid product key or else you will lose some functionality and see a message saying that your Windows is not genuine.
  
To activate your Windows 7 Ultimate, you will need to buy a legitimate product key from Microsoft or an authorized retailer.
